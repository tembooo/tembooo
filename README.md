## About me
About Me

Hi there! I'm Arman Golbidi, a Master's student in Data-Centric Engineering at LUT University (2024–2026). My concentration is in computer vision and pattern recognition, where I'm exploring how AI can interpret and learn from visual data. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from Islamic Azad University of Isfahan with a GPA of 19.40/20, which gave me a strong foundation in software development and ignited my passion for data-driven problem solving.

Professionally, I have a diverse background in both data engineering and software/hardware development. I’m currently working part-time as a Data Engineer at Valueqon Oy, where I contribute to data analytics projects using Microsoft Azure, Power BI, and Qlik Sense. Before moving to Finland, I spent several years at Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) as a Software/Electrical Engineer. At IRIB, I developed broadcast software in C# (with WPF) and PHP, maintained studio hardware and AV equipment, and even designed web front-ends and back-ends (HTML/CSS and WordPress). These experiences have made me proficient in a range of technologies, including Python, MATLAB, C#, PHP, and more.

I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’m continuously expanding my skills in these areas. I've earned multiple Codecademy certifications – for example, the Machine Learning/AI Engineer and Natural Language Processing Specialist career path certificates – which reflect my commitment to learning in AI and data science. I also co-authored a research publication on using lightweight convolutional neural networks to improve IoT security by detecting botnet attacks. In my free time, I enjoy tackling coding challenges and building personal projects to experiment with new ideas and technologies. This not only keeps my problem-solving sharp, but also keeps me up-to-date on emerging tech trends.

I'm fluent in English (TOEFL iBT 100) and am actively learning Finnish (A1 level). I believe in collaboration and continuous growth – I'm always open to new opportunities and love to learn something new every day. Feel free to reach out or collaborate on a project – I'm friendly, technically curious, and always eager to share knowledge and learn from others!

Arman Golbidi

### Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
| Title | Description | Repository | Tools |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|k-Nearest Neighbour| Utilizing machine learning techniques to implement a custom k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classifier for high-dimensional classification tasks. In this repository, I developed a Python-based solution that applies Euclidean distance to classify test samples using the k-NN algorithm. The project uses a 9-dimensional dataset, with a fixed train-test split (2/3 for training, 1/3 for testing) to ensure reproducibility. The algorithm dynamically resolves ties by reducing the value of `k` until a clear majority vote is achieved among neighbors. The final classifier is tested for values of `k` ranging from 1 to 8, and the optimal value determined is **k = 3**. This project demonstrates foundational concepts in pattern recognition and supervised learning, providing a clear, step-by-step pipeline for building and analyzing a k-NN classifier from scratch.|[k-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/tembooo/1.Nearest-Neighbour_Classifier-) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>| 
|Features and elementary classification|This mini-project demonstrates how to build a simple linear classifier using a small data set of 100 samples, 4 features, and 2 classes. It starts with onboarding data, including loading, inspecting, and optionally generating new features before splitting it for training and testing. It then carries out feature selection by examining all 2-feature combinations to find the best pair. In the final stage, a linear model based on Perceptron or Least Squares is trained to predict the data classes. The project focuses on key concepts like introducing bias terms, learning parameters, and avoiding overfitting using proper data splitting.|[Features and elementary classification](https://github.com/tembooo/2.Workshop-Features-and-elementary-classification) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>| 
| Support vector machine |This project demonstrates how to build a linear classifier step-by-step using a simple dataset. The focus is on understanding the complete process from data preparation and feature selection to training and evaluating a linear model. We aim to explore linear classification with Perceptron or least squares approaches in a practical setting.  The project is divided into three main stages, each handling a specific task in the pipeline.  All steps are implemented in Python, and the dataset is provided in both CSV and MAT formats.|[Support vector machine](https://github.com/tembooo/3.Support-vector-machine) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>|
| Non linear support vector machine |This project demonstrates the use of a second-order polynomial kernel nonlinear Support Vector Machine. The objective is to cluster a 2D data set by mapping the input space into a space of greater dimensions through kernel functions. The function takes is provided with training data, class labels, test data, and a penalty parameter, and outputs predicted labels. The data set includes pre-defined support vectors to help train and test the model. Scripts are all given in MATLAB and Python formats, and CSV and MAT data files.|[Non linear support vector machine](https://github.com/tembooo/4.Non-linear-support-vector-machine/tree/main) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>|
| Decision trees |This project explores the process of constructing a decision tree for classification using a dataset with three features. A decision tree is a recursive structure that helps make decisions based on feature splits, aiming to reduce uncertainty at each step. The focus here is on selecting the best feature at each node using a metric called **information gain**, which evaluates how well a feature separates the data. The task involves reading the dataset, computing entropy and information gain, and determining the best feature to split the root node. Both MATLAB and Python can be used for implementation, with sample data provided in CSV format.|[Decision trees](https://github.com/tembooo/5.Decision-trees-) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>|
| Random Forest |In this project, we implement a **Random Forest** classifier from scratch using bootstrapping and majority voting on multiple decision trees. Although we use standard libraries to train individual decision trees, the logic for sampling, training, and combining tree outputs is custom-built. The project explores the effect of the number of trees and training subset size on the model’s classification performance. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets such as **Arrhythmia**, **Iris**, and **Wine**, using both MATLAB and Python implementations. Results are compared to a baseline single decision tree model to show the power of ensemble learning.|[Random-Forest](https://github.com/tembooo/6.Random-Forest) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>|
