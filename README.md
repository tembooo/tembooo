## About me
About Me

Hi there! I'm Arman Golbidi, a Master's student in Data-Centric Engineering at LUT University (2024â€“2026). My concentration is in computer vision and pattern recognition, where I'm exploring how AI can interpret and learn from visual data. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering from Islamic Azad University of Isfahan with a GPA of 19.40/20, which gave me a strong foundation in software development and ignited my passion for data-driven problem solving.

Professionally, I have a diverse background in both data engineering and software/hardware development. Iâ€™m currently working part-time as a Data Engineer at Valueqon Oy, where I contribute to data analytics projects using Microsoft Azure, Power BI, and Qlik Sense. Before moving to Finland, I spent several years at Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) as a Software/Electrical Engineer. At IRIB, I developed broadcast software in C# (with WPF) and PHP, maintained studio hardware and AV equipment, and even designed web front-ends and back-ends (HTML/CSS and WordPress). These experiences have made me proficient in a range of technologies, including Python, MATLAB, C#, PHP, and more.

I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and Iâ€™m continuously expanding my skills in these areas. I've earned multiple Codecademy certifications â€“ for example, the Machine Learning/AI Engineer and Natural Language Processing Specialist career path certificates â€“ which reflect my commitment to learning in AI and data science. I also co-authored a research publication on using lightweight convolutional neural networks to improve IoT security by detecting botnet attacks. In my free time, I enjoy tackling coding challenges and building personal projects to experiment with new ideas and technologies. This not only keeps my problem-solving sharp, but also keeps me up-to-date on emerging tech trends.

I'm fluent in English (TOEFL iBT 100) and am actively learning Finnish (A1 level). I believe in collaboration and continuous growth â€“ I'm always open to new opportunities and love to learn something new every day. Feel free to reach out or collaborate on a project â€“ I'm friendly, technically curious, and always eager to share knowledge and learn from others!

Arman Golbidi

## My Projects
Here are some of the bigger projects I've worked with. Some of the projects are done for my studies and some for my own interests.
### Image processing and Computer vision
| Title | Description | Repository | Tools |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| ImageProcessing | Utilizing image processing techniques for sports broadcasting applications. In this repository, I've developed Python scripts employing methods such as Haar cascades, Viola-Jones algorithms, and advanced machine learning approaches like HOG and CNN for face and emotion detection. The project integrates datasets from Kaggle to identify and analyze user emotions in real-time video and static images. | [ImageProcessing]( https://github.com/tembooo/1.ImageProcessing) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/>| 
| Gender and age | This project applies real-time image processing techniques to detect gender and age groups from live webcam feeds and static images. Designed for use in broadcast environments, it helps identify the demographic attributes of individuals â€” including characters who have died in movies â€” based on visual input. | [Gender and age](https://github.com/tembooo/2.GendersAndAges) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/> | 
| Face Recognition | This project uses HOG-based feature extraction and the face_recognition library to identify known individuals in both static images and live webcam video. It was designed to recognize the faces of familiar people â€” such as colleagues or celebrities â€” by comparing them to a preloaded image database. | [Face Recognition]( https://github.com/tembooo/3.Face-Recognition) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/> | 
| Face Analysis | This project explores facial landmark detection and facial feature augmentation using the face_recognition library. It demonstrates how to extract and visually annotate key facial features like the chin, eyebrows, lips, and eyes â€” and how to simulate virtual makeup effects on both images and live webcam feeds. Built for both educational and entertainment purposes, the system supports:Static image landmark detection, Multi-face landmark detection, Live video stream face feature tracking, Virtual makeup overlay (eyebrows, lips, eyeliner) | [Face Analysis](https://github.com/tembooo/4.FaceAnalysis) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/> | 
| Object detection | This project demonstrates fundamental and advanced object detection and tracking techniques using OpenCV in Python. It covers a range of methods from template matching and corner detection to real-time object tracking with selectable algorithms such as KCF, MOSSE, and CSRT. Ideal for beginners and intermediate users exploring classical image processing and video object tracking, this repository includes both static and live examples with real-world visuals. | [Object detection](https://github.com/tembooo/5.Objectdetection) | <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/> |

The goal is to compare CNN and MLP models with and without regularization techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout. Through experimentation with five separate model architectures, this repository showcases how architectural choices affect model accuracy and generalization on handwritten digit recognition tasks. | [deeplearning in Digital image processing](https://github.com/tembooo/7.deeplearninginDigital-image-processing) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/> | 

### Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
| Title | Description | Repository | Tools |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
|k-Nearest Neighbour| Utilizing machine learning techniques to implement a custom k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classifier for high-dimensional classification tasks. In this repository, I developed a Python-based solution that applies Euclidean distance to classify test samples using the k-NN algorithm. The project uses a 9-dimensional dataset, with a fixed train-test split (2/3 for training, 1/3 for testing) to ensure reproducibility. The algorithm dynamically resolves ties by reducing the value of `k` until a clear majority vote is achieved among neighbors. The final classifier is tested for values of `k` ranging from 1 to 8, and the optimal value determined is **k = 3**. This project demonstrates foundational concepts in pattern recognition and supervised learning, providing a clear, step-by-step pipeline for building and analyzing a k-NN classifier from scratch.|[k-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/tembooo/1.Nearest-Neighbour_Classifier-) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>| 
|Features and elementary classification|This mini-project demonstrates how to build a simple linear classifier using a small data set of 100 samples, 4 features, and 2 classes. It starts with onboarding data, including loading, inspecting, and optionally generating new features before splitting it for training and testing. It then carries out feature selection by examining all 2-feature combinations to find the best pair. In the final stage, a linear model based on Perceptron or Least Squares is trained to predict the data classes. The project focuses on key concepts like introducing bias terms, learning parameters, and avoiding overfitting using proper data splitting.|[Features and elementary classification](https://github.com/tembooo/2.Workshop-Features-and-elementary-classification) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>| 
| Support vector machine |This project demonstrates how to build a linear classifier step-by-step using a simple dataset. The focus is on understanding the complete process from data preparation and feature selection to training and evaluating a linear model. We aim to explore linear classification with Perceptron or least squares approaches in a practical setting.  The project is divided into three main stages, each handling a specific task in the pipeline.  All steps are implemented in Python, and the dataset is provided in both CSV and MAT formats.|[Support vector machine](https://github.com/tembooo/3.Support-vector-machine) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="c" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/jupyter/jupyter-original.svg" alt="jupyter" width="40" height="40"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original.svg" alt="vscode" width="40" height="40"/>|
